# CSCI2275FinalProject

**Project Summary**

This program is a terminal based board game where the player rolls a dice and either gets or loses points based on which tile they landed on. The program contains two classes, which each use a linked list and a binary search tree respectively. The class BoardLL uses a linked list to represent the game board that is made up of nodes/tiles. The class PointsBST uses a binary search tree to keep track of and manipulate the player score.

**How to Run**

You can run the game simply by running the BoardGame.exe.

Alternatively you can build the program using

```
g++ -std=c++11 BoardGame.cpp BoardLL.cpp PointsBST.cpp -o BoardGame
```

and run it using

```
./BoardGame
```

**Dependencies**

This program uses no third-party libraries and has no dependencies other than the things that we use in class.

**System Requirements**

There shouldn't be any specific system requirements for this program.
